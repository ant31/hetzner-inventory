# Uncomment and configure as needed:
# hetzner_credentials:
#   # Default Robot credentials, used if no environment-specific credentials are set.
#   robot_user: "your_default_robot_user"
#   robot_password: "your_default_robot_password"
#   # Environment-specific Robot credentials.
#   robot_credentials:
#     staging:
#       user: "your_staging_robot_user"
#       password: "your_staging_robot_password"
#   hcloud_token: "your_default_hcloud_token"
#   hcloud_tokens:
#     production: "your_production_token"
#     staging: "your_staging_token"

# hetzner:
#   cluster_prefix: "z"
#   domain_name: "example.com"
#   vlan_id: 4000
#   robot_env_assignment:
#     # 1. Default environment for any server that doesn't match other rules.
#     default: "production"
#
#     # 2. Assign servers to 'staging' if they are connected to vSwitch with ID 4567.
#     # This is a broad rule that can be overridden by more specific rules.
#     by_vswitch:
#       '4567': "staging"
#
#     # 3. Assign servers based on name patterns. This is more specific than by_vswitch.
#     # For example, a server named 'dev-web-01' on vSwitch 4567 would be assigned to 'development'.
#     by_server_name_regex:
#       '^dev-': "development"
#
#     # 4. Assign specific servers by their ID. This has the highest precedence and overrides all other rules.
#     # For example, server 1234567 will be 'production-db' even if it's on vSwitch 4567 and named 'dev-db-01'.
#     by_server_id:
#       '1234567': "production-db"
#
#   envs:
#     staging:
#       vlan_id: 4002
#     development:
#       vlan_id: 4003
